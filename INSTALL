Windows Build
1) Down load the version of fribidi you intend to build from and
untar into a folder parallel to this one. I used fribidi-0.19.6
Either rename this folder to fribidi-src or create a link to the
one you downloaded eg
   cd .. && junction fribidi-src fribidi-0.19.6

2) Edit win/fribidi-config.h to reflect the correct version.

3) run vcvarsall.bat for the C platform you intend building for.

4) run the win/build.vbs script it should produce a build.out text
file containing messages from the script.

5) Assuming 4 worked you now have a configured fribidi source area.
build the extension module using
	python setup.py build


linux build
===========
We don't use setup.py we now have pyproject.toml

python setup.py sdist
pip wheel -w dist .
